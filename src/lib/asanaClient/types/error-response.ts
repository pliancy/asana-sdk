/**
 * Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can occur for a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API should return an HTTP Status Code that indicates the nature of the failure, with a response body in JSON format containing additional information.   In the event of a server error the response body will contain an error phrase. These phrases are automatically generated using the [node-asana-phrase library](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana-phrase) and can be used by Asana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server error.
